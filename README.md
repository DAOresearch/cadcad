## Setup

### Google Collab

[Google Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/ ) is probably the fastest and easiest way to get started if you have a [Google](https://google.com) account.

### VS Code

If you're working with [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) here's a few things that might be helpful:

- [VS Code Jupyter notebook basics](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support) - A walk through of the Jupyter UI in VS Code.
- [Keyboard shortcuts for VS Code Jupyter](https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence/jupyter-notebook-keyboard-shortcuts-for-beginners-5eef2cb14ce8) - TL;DR: enter, esc, a, b, dd, m, y, j, and k work as expected.
- [VS Code containers intro](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) - TL;DR: if you have [Docker](https://docker.com/) and the [VS Code remote containers extension](http://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-,%20thenvscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) installed then you can clone this repo locally, open the folder in a container, and the `.devcontainer` folder will automagically build a cadCAD environment for you locally.
