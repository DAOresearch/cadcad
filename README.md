## What is cadCAD?

cadCAD is complex adaptive dynamics in computer aided design. It helps in designing, understanding, and optimizing complex systems. It's open source, easy to integrate into data science workflows, and allows you to work with a large variety of system types across many industries.

You can learn more about why cadCAD exists and what it does here:

## Setup

### Google Collab

[Google Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/ ) is probably the fastest and easiest way to get started if you have a [Google](https://google.com) account.

### VS Code

If you're working with [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) here's a few things that might be helpful:

- [VS Code Jupyter notebook basics](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support) - A walk through of the Jupyter UI in VS Code.
- [Keyboard shortcuts for VS Code Jupyter](https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence/jupyter-notebook-keyboard-shortcuts-for-beginners-5eef2cb14ce8) - TL;DR: enter, esc, a, b, dd, m, y, j, and k work as expected.
- [VS Code containers intro](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) - TL;DR: if you have [Docker](https://docker.com/) and the [VS Code remote containers extension](http://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-,%20thenvscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) installed then you can clone this repo locally, open the folder in a container, and the `.devcontainer` folder will automagically build a cadCAD environment for you locally.

## Process

The process of creating a cadCAD model is both an art and a science. That being said, https://www.cadcad.education/ does a great job of explaining the basics. There's a review of all the python concepts you'll need to know, the components of a cadCAD systems, and examples of how to put it all together into a model. At the time of writing the course is free. Highly recommend checking it out.
