Stuff related to mapping out the DAO token/share distribution based on contributions and NFT creation.

Originally forked from the [cadCAD Predator Prey](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1AQugR2m89SpAxobk6Y_cppAFsPN6Eg7b#scrollTo=NkYUY69n1O70) example because that file ran without errors and populations growing or dying off seems similar enough to adoption/churn.

You can work on it by going to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), file, upload notebook, add the URL to this repo (`https://github.com/DAOresearch/cadcad`), then it should open up.
